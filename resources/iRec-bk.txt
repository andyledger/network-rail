Our crossing keeper roles are your entry into a rewarding career with Network Rail.    Our role is to run a safe, reliable and efficient railway, serving customers and communities. We exist to get  people and  goods where they need to be and to support our country’s economic prosperity.    We're under taking an ambitious change. Our vision is  Putting   Passengers First  – a company that is on the side of passengers and freight users; that is easy to engage with and is an  efficient anddependable partner ; a company  people are proud to work for ;instinctively recognised as an industry leader.    We’re an organisation where people matter. We matter to millions. Everyone matters is our diversity strategy.By 2024 we will be an even more open, diverse and inclusive organisation that is better at reflecting the communities that we serve.By putting our passengers first, our strategy will help us to provide a more accessible and more inclusive experience for you.  ^|UNUSED^| Every day you’ll be responsible for controlling the movement of crossing barriers that keep trains moving through on time. You’ll raise the barriers to let other users across the tracks only when it’s safe for them to do so. And you’ll be proactive in maintaining barriers and other crossing equipment, responding quickly to any faults or potential safety risks.     Each level crossing unique with different users, activity and equipment but safety is always paramount you’ll play a vital role in the onward journey of all users of your level crossing. This might mean challenging unsafe behaviour or managing difficult situations.    Your skills matter and many of our crossing keepers started with no formal rail experience and have also progressed into higher grade Signaller roles. Any work you’ve done which has required concentration, is safety critical and involves communicating with others would stand you in good stead.     Here are the transferrable skills you’ll need to show us      Communication  – A variety of clear   communication skills are essential as a crossing keeper.   Ability to learn  – You’ll be learning on the   job and will need this to work safely and confidently.   Ability to work alone  – Every crossing keeper   requires the ability to operate efficiently and make safety critical   decisions confidently and independently.   Ability to work as part of a   team  –   Whilst being able to work confidently alone, it is important that you are   a team player.   Attention to detail  – The role requires   consistent high levels of attention but varying levels of concentration.  When things go quiet you need to be   ready to spring into action.   Multi-Tasking  – You will be expected to   deal with phone calls, signal trains, block lines for maintenance work and   complete administration tasks.   Working Under Pressure  – Due to the intense and   challenging events that can occur on the railway, it is crucial you are   able to remain calm whilst working under pressure. Decision Making   - By its nature, you need to make safety critical decisions throughout the   course of your shift.     You’ll also need to be within a 60-minute commute of the location that you’re applying to work at and will need access to your own transport to allow for the different shift work.  This role involves days, nights and weekend working and the job is safety critical. Offers of employment are subject to drug and alcohol testing and passing of the relevant medical assessment and BPSS pre-employment checks.

A critical part of the work we do is the daily upkeep of the rail network. As an Operative you’ll work in a small team, supporting essential maintenance to keep the railway running safely and smoothly for passengers and freight users.   Our Operative community comes from a variety of different backgrounds, and this might be the first time that you’ve even considered a career in rail. We’re focused on your transferrable skills and behaviours and if you can demonstrate that, then we will provide you with all the necessary training to have you working safely and competently out on the network.     And if you make the grade then you can look forward to a rewarding and fulfilling career with a company that recently joined the top 50 in the Glassdoor's 2021 Best Places to Work.  ^|UNUSED^| Operatives specialise in a range of disciplines but for this role you’ll become a specialist in  Track:  You’ll be responsible for maintaining, inspecting and repairing the track network (also known as the Permanent Way or P-Way) to keep the railway safe and efficient.This is a very manual role as you’ll be working with rails, sleepers and ballast that support the trains, together with their associated drainage and ancillary structures.    Our Operatives work outside in all conditions, at all times of the year, day or night. You’ll be involved in demanding manual work, often with the need to transport kit across tricky terrain. Being safety focused, respectful of rules and a team player will be critical as you’ll often be working next to moving trains travelling at high speed.    You matter to your team    The team depends on you. You’re the one who shows up first and leaves last, who makes sure the van and equipment are checked and ready for every shift, and who drives the team from site to site.

You don’t necessarily need rail experience, but you do need to show how your transferrable skills meet the following:      Teamworking -  our maintenance teams depend on each other and you’ll be able to work closely with the team to deliver safe and efficient work delivery.     Communication  - you’ll have good communication skills so you can work safely and effectively.    Proactive planning -  being punctual, having the van and equipment ready and anticipating the needs of the team are essential to keeping our passengers and freight moving.     Working under pressure -  working outdoors in all conditions, and with trains passing close by means you’ll need to remain calm under pressure.     Following rules and instructions -  it is important that you understand and respect the rules, but also feel confident to challenge if you see a situation is unsafe.    Willingness to learn  - you’ll consistently develop your skills and competencies relevant to your discipline, keeping up to date with new standards, procedures, and instructions.        It matters that this is the right role for you.       Here’s some additional information which might help you.

Lead the preparation of the annual / bi-annual ‘Asset Management Statement’ (AMAS) reports to be produced for HS1 / ORR.  Identify the appropriate performance indicators for engineering assets and set the specifications for these performance indicators, checking that both the indicators and the specifications are consistent with the wider engineering and Network Rail goals.  Analyse existing asset data reports and lead the identification of Network Rail’s future needs for information on assets, including those arising from commitments to external organisations, working with other groups and functions across the company.  Provide advice to the IM relating to the data produced by the period reporting, and work with the Engineering functions to resolve any issues raised.   Review Backlog, Faults and other IMR data so there is consistent reporting. Establish the currently available information on assets, assessing its completeness, quality, and other factors affecting its suitability.  Manage nominated projects to improve the quality and availability of information on infrastructure assets.  Support discussions with external organisations, including the Office of Rail Regulation, on information on infrastructure assets.  Lead and deliver all NR(High Speed) deliverables to HS1, including AMAS, Asset Specific Policies, etc.    This is a fixed term contract for 12 months, so come and be part of a truly unique business that brings the UK closer to Europe.
